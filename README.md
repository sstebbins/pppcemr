# PPPCPro
This is a python web app port of [EncounterPro OS open source EHR created by Mark Copenhaver](http://encounterpro.org/).  No source code from this original project was used.

Please forgive the amateur quality of this code - I used this as a learning project.  

*This is a work in progress, and is not intended to be used in direct patient care. It should be considered an "alpha" version.*

# Installation

Install [python 3.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-350/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/). 

To familiarize yourself with Django, I highly recommend going through the [tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/).

Then, simply start the development test server.
```
python manage.py runserver
```
or, if you have both python 2.7 and 3.5 on your computer:
```
python3 manage.py runserver
```
